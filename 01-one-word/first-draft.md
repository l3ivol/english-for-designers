# Salute

Salute guys!

In my native language, the word "salute" translates to fireworks, but in many languages it can be used as a greeting.
I once heard it on TV as a child when a cheerful and friendly actor in a movie said it instead of a greeting. 
Being a kid I was interested in this word pun and thought about it a bit and imagined literally fireworks. Bright, loud, colorful in the sky, like at New Year's Eve or a big city celebration.  
Fireworks have always been synonymous with celebration, joy, and good cheer. For me, they became a symbol of a friendly, productive, and undoubtedly successful encounter with fellow human beings. While a person may hear 'hello' multiple times a day from various people, 'salute' stands out and invites a more attentive and heartfelt response. I grew to cherish the word 'salute' for its ability to infuse each encounter with a sense of festivity and positive anticipation.
From that moment on, I adopted 'salute' into my everyday vocabulary. This association has become a source of inspiration and a talisman, ensuring that every meeting, no matter how routine, feels unique and promising. Such associations and metaphors have the power to transform the ordinary into something extraordinary, infusing even the most routine encounters with new, positive meanings.
What's even more special is that I vividly remember the origin of this word in my lexicon. It's a connection that I treasure, a small secret that I share with those I greet with a 'salute.' This simple word serves as a constant reminder of the uniqueness and potential of every interaction, making each 'salute' a miniature celebration of human connection."
