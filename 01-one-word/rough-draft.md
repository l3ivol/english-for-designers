## Rough Draft

# Salute

I like the word fireworks. 
In my native language, the word salute translates to fireworks. 
But once as a child I heard it on TV when an actor said it instead of hello. 
As a kid I thought about it a lot and imagined literally fireworks. Bright and in the sky, like on New Year's Eve or a big city holiday,
but in honor of meeting the person I say fireworks to.
Fireworks are associated with a holiday of fun and good cheer, so for me it's like a symbol of a successful meeting with a friend.
This association is still relevant to me and I often say salute instead of hello and the cool thing is that I remember where this word came from as opposed to the word fax
