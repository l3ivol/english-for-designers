"Salute, my friends!

In my native language, the word "salute" translates to "fireworks", but in many languages it serves as a warm and friendly greeting. 
I first encountered this word as a child while watching a movie where a cheerful actor used it instead of "hello." 
I was intrigued by this play on words and began to ponder its meaning. 
I imagined a bright fireworks display - bright, loud, bursting with color, similar to the spectacular displays we see on New Year's Eve or during grand urban celebrations.

Fireworks have always been synonymous with celebration, joy and good mood. And for me, they have become a symbol of friendly and productive communication with the people around me. 
If "hello" a person can hear from different people several times a day, then "salute" stands out and requires a more attentive and sincere response. 
I've grown to love the word "hello" for its ability to fill every encounter with a sense of celebration and positive anticipation.

From that moment on, I incorporated the word "salute" into my everyday vocabulary. This association has become a source of inspiration and a talisman that makes every meeting, 
no matter how routine, seem unique and promising. Such associations and metaphors can transform the ordinary into something extraordinary,
filling even the most routine meetings with new, positive meaning.

What's even more unusual is that I clearly remember the origin of this word in my vocabulary. 
It is a bond I cherish, a little secret I share with those I greet with a "salute." 
This simple word serves as a constant reminder of the uniqueness and potential of each interaction, turning each 'hello' into a miniature celebration of human connection."
