Hey there, I'm Marek, a photographer. I graduate of Michael Academy. I've been in the world of photography for quite some time, creating portrait shots for Reporter magazine and collaborating with different companies to create portfolios of important people.

Beyond the lens, you'll often find me playing electric guitar or diving into some PlayStation gaming during my downtime. Back in the day, I was all about sports, but as the years roll by, I've developed a taste for kicking back with a good drink and taking it easy.

If winter come, I'm all about hitting the slopes for some skiing action in the mountains. When summer comes, I trade ski for the motocross bike. It's all about balancing the artistic side of photography with the adrenaline rush of outdoor adventures.

## Featured Projects

I've chosen projects that I'm happy with and have moved me in the professional world to where I am now. I chose projects in the art world. Since I studied film from the beginning I share this stage of work as well.

### JOJO RABBIT

- A movie for the American production company Fox Searchlight Pictures
- Jojo Rabbit is a 2019 war comedy-drama film written and directed by Taika Waititi
- I've done DIT and dailies work on the film.

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

### Reporter Magazin

- Reporter is a Czech magazine published monthly since September 2014.
- I've been working with the magazine for over three years now and together we create photographs for the articles that the writers create. The photographs are published both in print and in online articles.
- I get to meet interesting people and create something that is printed every month and goes to the shops.

### McDonald's

- The owner saw my work and requested me as a photographer. Since then we have been in touch and planning other projects.
