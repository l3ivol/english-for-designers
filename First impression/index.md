## About me

One of my personal philosophies is **challenging assumptions and looking for "out of the box" solutions, merging craft, intention and loosely-held convictions in order to build something truly great.**

My skills have about **5 years of practical** experience in creating visual identity for brands from different business sectors, specifically **creating logos, slogans, general concept of visual communication, web pages from small lendings to full-fledged online stores, packaging design and so on.** In addition to the visual side of the designer's work, I have extensive **experience in UX**, my strengths are in- **depth interviews, highlighting the main values of the brand and defining the positioning in the market, which contribute to a high conversion rate for the tasks at hand.**  

My experience is not limited to UI/UX design; it also covers areas such as **marketing, psychology and personal brand.**
I strive for **meticulous design excellence and adhere to analytical decision making and principal brand and individual product strategy** to create strong and confident brands that make a difference in people's lives.

### My origin story: 
I moved away from my parents when I was 14 to live independently and support myself. Since then, I have faced hardships and various challenges every day, which have hardened me and given me a wealth of life experience that I have carried over into design. This profession has been a great opportunity for me to show my skills and truly define my place in the modern world.
