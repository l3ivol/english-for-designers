## About me

**As a Creative Director with more than seven years of experience in visual arts,** my true passion lies in crafting visual identities. I hold a firm belief that the **visual identity forms the essence of a brand**. This belief drives my commitment to both the creation of branding and its marketing evolution.

My experience spans several years in **designing and optimizing websites for users**. My enthusiasm for learning isn't confined to just design and UI/UX; it also encompasses fields like marketing, psychology, and personal development.

I adhere to the Bauhaus principle that **form follows function**, upholding that my work should not only be aesthetically pleasing and timeless but also straightforward and practical for real-world application.

### My origin story: 
When I was about 13 or 14, I began my journey. I wanted to make a cool place for my gamer friends to hang out, but **we needed a profile picture** to show who we are. Later I found out those are logos. People usually pay for that, but I had no money, so **I decided to make it myself.** I had a blast and made something really cool, and that's how I started with graphic designer. I still use that picture for my Discord group to this day!

My first big "job" was in 2018. I volunteered on a project called Hug Day about people from all over the world giving hugs to bring back physical contact. **It was awesome to see my work go global and to realize I could change things with my designs.**

Now, I've been doing this as a job for over 7 years and playing with design stuff for 10 years. It's been an amazing ride!
