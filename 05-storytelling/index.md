# THE PATH OF MY DESIGN

Dear friends, glad to see you. Today I want to tell you about my path in design, because I think I can inspire the guys like me.

All my childhood I dreamed of becoming a doctor. In kindergarten I often dressed up in costumes and played the role of a doctor. I was always protective of my peers who were being bullied.
In computer games like "Call Of Duty", I chose a character with medical abilities.   I was in a chemistry and biology class and was always participating in science competitions and didn't associate myself with anything creative.

In high school, I watched shows like “Dr. House” and even online YouTube shows about neurosurgery and was really excited. So much so that I was confident in who I was and what I was going to do with my life. I didn't see myself as anything but a doctor! It was very important to me to help the people around me!
I entered the medical faculty of a prestigious medical university in Russia. Remembering that time I still have goosebumps from daily rises at 6 In the morning.   Anatomy classes, where we were taught by the example of embalmed body parts by people who after death donated their bodies to science.   Night duty, on which you are obliged to help patients who have problems with even going to the bathroom by themselves. It's an unforgettable emotion, I was doing pretty well, learning a lot of new things, until one day I had a strange feeling that I was missing something and not doing what my personality demanded.

It took me a while to realize the feeling, but I definitely felt panic because all my attention was focused on medicine, I was afraid that maybe I had chosen the wrong life for me, simply because I was always focused on one scenario. I thought: yes, I've dreamed of being a doctor all my life, but maybe this isn't me? 
Maybe I've switched? In the back of my mind, I wanted to try everything at once. To go to different places, to try my hand at more things that I had ignored for a long time. 
In short, I wanted to give myself another chance to think, reflect and to go back to finding myself and my future professional path.
These reflections became a turning point and the new me decided to give up my childhood dream of becoming a doctor, to stop identifying myself as a pragmatist and a serious person. Something is missing and I don't do what my personality demands. 
The new Vlad decided to quit medical school and go to Europe in search of new opportunities.

It is no exaggeration to say that my life changed after that. On new place, I started to make international friendships, which were mostly related to the visual arts. 
I felt completely new.
I became really interested and I started to discover new personality traits in myself. 
I realized that, without noticing it myself, I was sharing with the guys my opinion about their creative works and giving them recommendations, which the guys used, and after that I almost always received positive feedback. That's how I realized that I always have a lot of interesting creative ideas that I come up with literally on the spot for any situation, I have taste and, if it can be called that, a special vision, which I have always considered important for an artist. I felt a new power within myself that I never even dreamed I had. 
I wanted to cry because I was once again so inspired by something that I was ready to dedicate my whole life to it! In result serious and pragmatic Vlad changed and became a bright, cheerful and filled with creativity. I was open to everything! 

With great enthusiasm I started studying design programs, because I thought it was a good way to combine creative work and earn money. 
I actively searched for projects where I could realize my creative ambitions and learn new things. The road began to appear in front of me. I felt like I was in my place and I didn't look back. Not afraid to take risks, I was finally able to find myself and start living life to the fullest.  This is the true story of my life. 
These memories mean a lot to me, and I want to believe that anyone who finds themselves in the same situation and hears my story will have the motivation and desire to listen to their heart, as I once did, and embark on the adventure called life! You will gain so much more than you are afraid to lose!

I am now graduating from university with a degree in graphic design, my life is all about art and creativity, from the everyday things I do to the amount of people I am surrounded by, which makes me truly happy. I'm finally settling down and feel like I belong. I recently did a project dedicated to my future clothing brand, the intention of which is to unleash the creative potential of each individual. I find this coincidence very symbolic in the context of the story I told today!
I want to become a real specialist in my profession, to become a part of the design community, but it is not enough for me just to be excellent at what I do. I truly want to change the world of design for the better, so I have a big goal to influence it in a way that will change people's world, to contribute to new discoveries in the world of visual communication.
