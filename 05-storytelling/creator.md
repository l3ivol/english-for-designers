# More about my last project- clothing brand "Creator"
 
Creator's goal is to become a bridge between designer and consumer, to remove the boundaries of traditional ideas about clothing and offer everyone the opportunity to express their unique individuality.

We go by slogan:

### "Everyone is a creator!"

We offer a unique product that allows everyone to constantly experiment with their image, thanks to replaceable patches. 
Our approach to branding is based on the principles of uniqueness and personalization.

However, as a brand, CREATOR strive not only to individualize and express ourselves individually, but also to respond to social issues by bringing people together to solve them.
For example, collaborating with artists who support nature protection. Such cooperation turns into an act of support for important social movements and helps to bring important ideas to 
the masses.
