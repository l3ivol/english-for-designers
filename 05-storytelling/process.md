# Work in process
Hi, Justin. I want to tell you about my journey in design, because I think I can inspire the guys who are in my shoes.

I spent my entire childhood dreaming of becoming a doctor.
In kindergarten, I often dressed up in a costume and played the role of a doctor. 
In computer games like COD, I chose a character with medical ability. 
I entered chemistry and biology class, constantly participated in science competitions and did not associate myself with something creative. 
I watched shows like Doctor House in high school, and even online shows on YouTube of real neurosurgical surgeries and genuinely got excited from. So much so that I was confident in who I was and what I would be doing with my life. I didn't see myself as anything but a doctor!

I entered the medical faculty of a prestigious medical university in Russia and I was doing great, until one day I had a strange feeling that I was missing something and was not doing what my personality required. 
It took me a while to be able to recognize this feeling, but I definitely felt panic because my focus was on medicine, I was afraid that I might be choosing the wrong life for me, just because I was always focused on one scenario for my future. What I really wanted was to do everything at once. To be in different places, to try myself at more things that I had ignored for a long time. In short-term, I wanted to go back to searching for myself and my future professional path.

These reflections became a turning point and I decided to give up my childhood dream of becoming a doctor, to stop identifying myself as a pragmatic and a serious person. I decided to quit medical school and go to Europe to find new opportunities and discoveries. 

After that, it is no exaggeration to say that my life changed. I started to make international acquaintances and friends in the new place, who were mostly related to the visual arts. 
I was really interested in and started to discover new traits of my personality.
I realized that without noticing it I was sharing my opinion with the guys about their creative works and giving them recommendations, which the guys used and after that I almost always received positive feedback. So I realized that I always have a lot of interesting creative ideas that I come up with literally on go for any situation, I have taste and if I can call it - special vision, which I always thought was a important thing to be an artist. I felt a new power in myself that I never dreamed of. I wanted to cry because I was so inspired by something again that I was ready to dedicate my life to it!

I started learning about design programs. I found new projects on which I could realize my creative ambitions. The road began to appear in front of my feet and i never looked back.
By not being afraid to take risks, I was able to finally find myself and start living life to the fullest. 

It means a lot to me, so I really hope that everyone who is in a same situation and hears my story will have the courage to listen to their heart, like I once did, and go on an adventure. You will gain much more than you are afraid to lose!

I am now graduating from university as a graphic designer, my life is all about art and creativity, from daily tasks to the amount of people that surround me, which makes me truly happy. I have finally settled down and feel like I belong.

 I want to become a true specialist in my profession, to be part of the design community, but it doesn't seem enough for me to just to be great at what I do. I really want to make a difference in the design world and I aim to influence it in a way that will change people's world so that I can contribute to new openings in the world of visual communication. 

''Art it is everything around you and I want to be an irreplaceable part of it''. 

This is the slogan I go by!
